#Gapminder exploration and use of dplyr
This is an R Markdown document used for exploring the gapminder dataset through the functions of the dplyr package. 

##Loading data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Smell test the data



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
