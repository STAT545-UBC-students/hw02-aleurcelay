## Gapminder exploration and use of dplyr

This is an R Markdown document used for exploring the gapminder dataset through the functions of the dplyr package.
This document is intented to serve as a "cheatsheet" for future work on R.

## Loading data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```


## Smell test the data

**Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?**

```{r}
gapminder
typeof(gapminder)
```

When printing `gapminder` I can see the variables of the data set are arranged in columns and the observations of these variables are arranged in rows. This is a two dimensional object that holds different types of data. 
I know this object is a data frame.

The function `typeof()` determines the (R internal) type or storage mode of an object. The type of this data set is a **list**. A list in R allows to gather a variety of objects under one name in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, other lists, etc. 

**What is its class?**

```{r}
class(gapminder)
```

The `class()`function confirms that gapminder is a data frame. :+1:

**How many variables/columns?**

```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
```
**How many rows/observations?**

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```

`ncol()` and `nrow()` functions return the number of columns and rows, respectively.

**Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?**

```{r}
dim(gapminder) #rows, columns
length(gapminder) #Number of columns
```

I can get the same information with `dim()` function, the output is (number of rows, number of columns). Functions are useful depending on what we want to look at. If I just want to know how big is my dataset dim() is great, if I for example want to iterate, on either columns or rows, then ncol or nrow would be sufficient.


**What data type is each variable?**

```{r}
lapply(gapminder,class) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  kable(col.names = "Data type",align = 'lc')
```

I can also get all the above information with `str()` function:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

## Explore individual variables

Here I explore the categorical variable `country` and the quantitative variable `lifeExp`.

### country

I would like to know how many countries are stored within `country`:

```{r}
n_distinct(gapminder$country)
```
Another way to do this is and to get all the unique values (all countries) is by using `unique()`:

```{r}
unique(gapminder$country)
```

### lifeExp 

For the life expectancy variable I would like to know the range of the values:

```{r}
range(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

The range, quartiles, median, and mean can all be obtained through `summary()`:
```{r}
summary(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

Know I want to look at the distribution of `lifeExp` by combining the histogram of the variable and a Kernel density plot.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
         geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),fill = "cornflowerblue", bins=50) +
  geom_density()
```
The histogram shows two main peaks, where the most values are found: the biggest one around 70 years and the other one, close to 50 years.

## Explore various plot types

### A scatterplot of two quantitative variables

In this section I will explore gdpPercap as a function of lifeExp:

```{r}
  ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp,gdpPercap, color=continent)) +
    geom_point(aes(alpha=year)) +
    scale_y_log10()
```

In the above graph I used transparency to differentiate the year of the data.
Now, I will just use the last year of data, which is 2007:

```{r}
a<-gapminder%>%
  filter(year == 2007)
a
```

```{r}
ggplot(a, aes(lifeExp,gdpPercap, color=continent)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_log10()
```
This graph presents data from only one year. It is easily appreciated the difference overall between lifeExp and gdpPercap in African countries where it is lower than in Europe and Oceania.

### A plot of one quantitative variable.

Now, I will look at the lifeExp data arranged by continent with a frequency polygon:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```
This plot shows the frequency of life expectancy values within the dataset. We can see a discrepancy between the most common values for life expectancy in Africa and Europe. 

And now lets look at the distribution of this same variable among continents.
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, fill=continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.3)
```
In this plot it is easily appreciated that Europe and Oceania present a more homogenous distribution of life expectancy, while the rest of the continents have a wider range of values, probably because of bigger socio-economic gaps between countries.

```{r include = FALSE}
echo=FALSE
library(cowplot)
```


### Plot of one quantitative variable and one categorical.

First, I will arrange my data:

```{r}
# for the gapminder, group by continent
# to show the average Life Expectancy (LE) per continent
LEbyCont <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(avgLE = mean(lifeExp)) 

kable(LEbyCont, #Table to plot
      col.names = c('Continent', 'Avg. Life Expectancy'), #name the columns
      digits = 1, #round to 1 decimal
      align = 'lc') #Column alignment 'lc' is for the first column left aligned 'l', and second centered 'c'
#LEbyCont
```

Now I will do the plot to present average of life expectancy in each continent.

```{r}
# plot the avg Life Expectancy for each continent

LEbyCont <- LEbyCont %>% mutate(avgLE = round(avgLE, 1)) #round numbers of Avg. Life Expectancy
ggplot(LEbyCont, #table to plot
  aes(x = continent, y = avgLE, color = continent, label = avgLE)) +  #aesthetic mappings and select the AvgLE as the     labels on the plot
  geom_point(size=4) + #size of points in the plot
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy by Continent") +  #title of the plot
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Avg. Life Expectancy (years)") + #x and y labels
  geom_text(aes(label=avgLE),hjust=-0.3, vjust=0)#adjust the place of the labels
```

Here, it is easily appreciated the overall difference of the average life expectancy between continents. 

```{r}
g1 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, pop, fill = continent)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      scale_y_log10() +
      theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
      xlab("")
g2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
      geom_boxplot()+
      theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
      xlab("") +
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,90,by=10))
plot_grid(g1, g2) #used plot_grid to put plots together
```

The boxplots show population and life expectancy variables for all the continents. 
We can see a wide spread distribution of both variables mostly in Asia and Africa.
Although there are distinct outliers in both plots, I was particularly interested on the outlier in Africa, where life expectancy is very low. 

## Use filter(), select() and %>%

So let's try to find that data point:

```{r}
x<-gapminder %>%
  filter(continent %in% "Africa", lifeExp<30) %>%
  select(country,lifeExp, year)
x

```

After finding this very low value of life expectancy in Rwanda in 1992, I researched a bit for an explanation of this, and learnt about the Rwandan Civil War during which many people were killed and therefore, the impact on this variable. 

I want to see how life expectancy in Rwanda behaved before and after this event:

```{r}
gapminder%>%
  filter(country %in% c("Rwanda")) %>%
  select(lifeExp, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,lifeExp)) +
  ggtitle("Historical Life Expectancy in Rwanda") +
  geom_point(color="red") +
  geom_path(alpha=0.2)
```
We can see that before this event, the trend of life expectancy was to go higher, but becaise of this terrible event, life expectancy drop dramatically and took about 20 years to recover. 

I suspect this event also impacted the variable of population:

```{r}
gapminder%>%
  filter(country %in% c("Rwanda")) %>%
  select(pop, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,pop)) +
  ggtitle("Historical population in Rwanda") +
  geom_point(color="red") +
  geom_path(alpha=0.2)
```
In this graph we can see that not only the population didn't grow but it even decreased during this period of Rwanda's history.

## But I want to do more!

Evaluate this code and describe the result. Presumably the analyst’s intent was to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed? Why or why not? If not, what is the correct way to do this?

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan")) %>%
  kable(.)
```

When running this code, I can see that some years of data are missing, since == is a logical operator that compares two things that are the same length. 
So in this sense, as we have 12 years of data 6 and 6 go to each country. So if we add a third country, 4 years would be displayed for each one as shown below:
```{r}
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan", "Mexico")) %>%
  kable(.)
```

To extract all the data from Rwanda and Afghanistan, the analyst should use `%in%` operator instead. 
Let's try it:

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan")) %>%
  kable(.)
```

Now we have all the data from both countries :thumbsup:
