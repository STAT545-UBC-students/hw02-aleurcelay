#Gapminder exploration and use of dplyr
This is an R Markdown document used for exploring the gapminder dataset through the functions of the dplyr package. 

##Loading data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Smell test the data
Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?

```{r}
gapminder
typeof(gapminder)
```
When printing *gapminder* I can see the variables of the data set are arranged in columns and the observations of these variables are arranged in rows. This is a two dimensional object that holds different types of data. 
I know this object is a data frame.

The function typeof() determines the (R internal) type or storage mode of an object. The type of this data set is a list. A list in R allows to gather a variety of objects under one name in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, other lists, etc. 

What is its class?
```{r}
class(gapminder)
```
The class() confirms that gapminder is a data frame. :+1:

How many variables/columns?
```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
```
How many rows/observations?
```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```
ncol() and nrow() returns the number of columns and rows, respectively.

Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```
I can get the same information with dim() function, the output is (number of rows, number of columns). 

What data type is each variable?

I can also get the above information with str() function.
Which also returns the data type of each variable contained in the dataset:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
