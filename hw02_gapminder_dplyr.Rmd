#Gapminder exploration and use of dplyr
This is an R Markdown document used for exploring the gapminder dataset through the functions of the dplyr package.
This document is intented to serve as a "cheatsheet" for future work on R.

##Loading data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Smell test the data

Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?

```{r}
gapminder
typeof(gapminder)
```
When printing `gapminder` I can see the variables of the data set are arranged in columns and the observations of these variables are arranged in rows. This is a two dimensional object that holds different types of data. 
I know this object is a data frame.

The function `typeof()` determines the (R internal) type or storage mode of an object. The type of this data set is a list. A list in R allows to gather a variety of objects under one name in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, other lists, etc. 

What is its class?
```{r}
class(gapminder)
```
The `class()`function confirms that gapminder is a data frame. :+1:

How many variables/columns?
```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
```
How many rows/observations?
```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```
`ncol()` and `nrow()` functions return the number of columns and rows, respectively.

Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```
I can get the same information with `dim()` function, the output is (number of rows, number of columns). 

What data type is each variable?

I can also get the above information with `str()` function.
Which also returns the data type of each variable contained in the dataset:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

##Explore individual variables

Here I explore the categorical variable `country` and the quantitative variable of population `pop`.

I would like to know how many countries are stored in the variable:
```{r}
n_distinct(gapminder$country)
```
And the unique values (all countries) stored:

```{r}
unique(gapminder$country)
```

For the population variable I would like to know the range of the values first:

```{r}
range(gapminder$pop)
```

```{r}
summary(gapminder$pop)
```
